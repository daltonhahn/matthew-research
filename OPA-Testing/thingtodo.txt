Attempting to currently do:
    Figure out a way to churn out a yaml template given a set of variables via bash/python/c/c++/anymeanspossible script
    Use old graphing code to create a way to graph the system that we create via the yaml template
        we're trying to figure out the connectiveness! 
            given some amount of inputs about a system, create a visual component and fake service templates
